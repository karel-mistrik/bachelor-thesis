            Radwimps formed in 2001 in Kanagawa, Japan during their first year
            of high school.[1][13] The five original members had been friends
            since middle school.[14] Lead vocalist Yojiro Noda first became
            interested in music after hearing Oasis in middle school, when he
            would try to remember the guitar chords and sing to Oasis
            songs.[13][15] The band's activities were initially centred on
            Yokohama,[1] and their first performance took place on BB Street in
            Kannai district on 5 February 2002.[15] At this point, guitarist
            Akira Kuwahara dropped out of high school in order to focus on the
            band.[15] In September and August 2002, Radwimps partook in the
            Yokohama High School Music Festival and eventually won the grand
            prize for the competition with the song "Moshi mo".[16] "Moshi mo"
            was released as the band's debut single in May 2003, with 10,000
            copies pressed and sold for 100 yen each.[14] Following this single,
            Radwimps toured the Yokohama area, including a performance as the
            sole act at Yokohama's Club 24West.[15] The band released their
            debut album, Radwimps, in July through independent label Newtraxx,
            featuring songs they wrote in middle school. The following August,
            was finalized by the end of the year and released in March.[15]
            Directly after the release, the group departed on a five-month
            Radwimps Haruna Tour (はるなっTOUR) and also performed at
            high-profile summer music festivals, such as Setstock, Rock in
            Japan, and Summer Sonic.[14][15] During this time, the band released
            a third single, "Hexun / Kanashi", which was their first charting
            release.[17] In November, the band made their major debut under
            Toshiba EMI, with the single "Nijūgoko-me no Senshokutai",[14]
            followed by "EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)" in January, both
            of which rose to the top 50.[17] In shifting to a major label, Noda
            explained that the band took the same stance as they had as an
            independent group, and that "If we thought we were bigger on a major
            label, that would have been a big mistake".[13][18] The band's third
            and first major-label album, Radwimps 3: Mujintō ni Motte
            Ikiwasureta Ichimai, regraded 3 in March 2006, was a landmark in
            establishing their popularity, debuting at number 13 on Oricon's
            album charts.[17] Radwimps 3 saw a change in the band's musical
            style, allowing them to be more experimental in their after

            a guest appearance at the Yokohama High School Music Festival, the
            band went on hiatus for Noda and other members to focus on their
            school exams.[13] Radwimps returned from hiatus in March 2004,
            though Kei Asō, Yūsuke Saiki, and Akio Shibafumi did not rejoin the
            group. To replace the musicians, the band added acquaintances, such
            as drummer Satoshi Yamaguchi and bassist Yusuke Takeda.[14][15]
            Radwimps immediately began recording new songs, and by July had
            released a second single, "Kiseki", and performed a three-month
            Japan-wide tour.[1][15] Right after the end of the tour, the band
            started work on their second album, Radwimps 2: Hatten Tojō, which
            was finalized by the end of the year and released in March.[15]
